3. `checkUpkeep` function check's if the lottery has ended or not, If the lottery has ended `performUpkeep` function is called.
4. `performUpkeep` requests for random numbers generated by `chainlinkVRF` .
5. `fulfillRandomWords` function will assign the winner to the lottery using the random number
6. `payout` function will pay the lottery winner their share.
